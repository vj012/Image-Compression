# Image-Compression

A simple python command line app to compress images. It can be used to seamlessly compress and decompress images in .png, .bmp, .tiff, .git, .exif and 
other image formats. Does not have .jpg support as they are already highly compressed. It uses the K-Means Algorithm to form clusters which is 
representative of its mean color. It then uses these mean colors to decompress the image back. A sample outcome for this program with number of 
clusters set to 16.
